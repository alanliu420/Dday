<h1>How To Survive a DoomsDay</h1>

<h2>Step 1: Be prepared</h2>
<p>
  If you live in a high priority area most likely to get attacked with a nuclear weapon:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>United States</li>
  <li>North Korea</li>
  <li>Russia</li>
  <li>Iraq</li>
  <li>Iran</li>
  <li>Hawaii</li>
  <li>Manhattan</li>
  <li>Tokyo</li>
  <li>Israel</li>
  <li>Guam</li>
  <li>Seoul</li>
</ul>

<p>
  You should know that if you live in any of these places you are more likely to get
  attacked by a nuclear bomb. If you don't live in any of these places then that does not mean you will not get attacked by a nuclear Weapon.

</p>

 <h3>Step 2: When fallout begins</h3>

 <p>
You should pack away food for the bunker so that you are not ill prepared
and are more likely to survive the time necessary in the
bunker.This will allow you as a survivor to continue to prosper throughout the disaster and eventually come out of the bunker well prepared to continue your life.



<ul>
 <li>Water allow enough water for each person in shelter.</li>
 <li>MRE or Meals Ready to Eat</li>
 <li>anything that is canned including spam</li>
 <li>Bleach for water if needed</li>
 <li>ECT</li>
 <li>Any entertainment like board games</li>

</ul>

 </p>


<h4>Step:3 Wait around 2 weeks</h4>

<p>Wait for the apocalypse to begin and then head to the bunker.
If you are certain that the disaster is real and not a warning then seal bunker.
You should be safe in the bunker and it is not recommended to come out of the bunker until you are certain that the disaster has passed.
Remember that there could still be fallout from the disaster whether natural or nuclear.
It takes around 2 weeks for 91% of fallout to neutrilize.
